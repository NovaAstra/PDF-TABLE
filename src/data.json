Communication, more so with these girls, after hours. We hope Jennifer answers her phone, because we don't want the after hours team. We have to go through all the steps again. Gabe was very very helpful with the whole issues Julie was having with how she logs in. Scott-if we tighten up, would we move to the 8. Shawn-sure. In the beginning, it was that you are 24/7 but we avoid the after hours team. Mindy-they are less knowledgeable which is understandable. Scott-they have the IT capabilities but they do have a learning curve. Over time, it will get better. Shawn-Jennifer, Jon, we appreciate having someone to reach out to. Having access to other people. It's helped us move things along. I think we are on the right path. \n\nSummary - Overall feels we are on the right track\no\tCommunication is an issue\no\tMigration to new server was an issue, working out the kicks\no\tAfter hours service is not as knowledgeable\no\tHaving someone to reach out to has been helpful\n\n",

Communication, more so with these girls, after hours. We hope Jennifer answers her phone, because we don't want the after hours team. We have to go through all the steps again. Gabe was very very helpful with the whole issues Julie was having with how she logs in. Scott-if we tighten up, would we move to the 8. Shawn-sure. In the beginning, it was that you are 24/7 but we avoid the after hours team. Mindy-they are less knowledgeable which is understandable. Scott-they have the IT capabilities but they do have a learning curve. Over time, it will get better. Shawn-Jennifer, Jon, we appreciate having someone to reach out to. Having access to other people. It's helped us move things along. I think we are on the right path. \n\nSummary - Overall feels we are on the right track\no\tCommunication is an issue\no\tMigration to new server was an issue, working out the kicks\no\tAfter hours service is not as knowledgeable\no\tHaving someone to reach out to has been helpful\n\n",

Password things we found out Michael had the entire time. I would say Jennifer is on it and gives us her number. Shawn-I would say a 7 too. the migration. We are working through kinks. Communication, more so with these girls, after hours. We hope Jennifer answers her phone, because we don't want the after hours team. We have to go through all the steps again. Gabe was very very helpful with the whole issues Julie was having with how she logs in. Scott-if we tighten up, would we move to the 8. Shawn-sure. In the beginning, it was that you are 24/7 but we avoid the after hours team. Mindy-they are less knowledgeable which is understandable. Scott-they have the IT capabilities but they do have a learning curve. Over time, it will get better. Shawn-Jennifer, Jon, we appreciate having someone to reach out to. Having access to other people. It's helped us move things along. I think we are on the right path. \n\nSummary - Overall feels we are on the right track\no\tCommunication is an issue\no\tMigration to new server was an issue, working out the kicks\no\tAfter hours service is not as knowledgeable\no\tHaving someone to reach out to has been helpful\n\n",
